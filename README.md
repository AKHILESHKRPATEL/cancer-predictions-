# Welcome to my GitHub repository on Using Predictive Analytics model to  cancer Prediction .

**Objective-**

The aim of this repository is to provide a platform for learning machine learning by utilizing a given dataset. It involves applying basic machine learning concepts, interpreting and evaluating the results based on the observed dataset, and creating computational records to document the thought process. The analysis is segmented into four parts and stored in Jupyter notebooks in this repository, which are:

1-Identifying the problem and sources of data<br/>
2-Conducting an exploratory data analysis<br/>  
3-Pre-processing the data<br/> 
4-Developing a model that predicts whether breast cell tissue is benign or malignant. <br/>
